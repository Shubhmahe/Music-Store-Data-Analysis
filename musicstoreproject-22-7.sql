order by levels desc 
limit 1 ; 

## 2. Which countries have the most Invoices ? 

select count(*) as c , billing_country 
from invoice
group by billing_country 
order by c desc ;  

## 3. What are top 3 values of total invoice?

select * from  invoice  ## if we want whole data 
order by total desc 
limit 3 ; 

select total from  invoice  ## if we want number of total colmn
order by total desc

### moderate level  Question Set 2 â€“ Moderate

## 1. Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A

select * from genre; 
select * from customer ; 
select * from employee ; 

select c.email, c.first_name, c.last_name, g.name

order by c.email asc ;  

 ## 2. Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands 
 
 select  ar.artist_id, ar.name , count(ar.artist_id) as 'totaltrackcount'
 from track as t 
 join album2 as al on al.album_id= t.album_id 
 join artist as ar on ar.artist_id = al.artist_id 
 join genre as g on g.genre_id=t.genre_id
 where g.name like 'Rock'
 group by ar.artist_id
 order by totaltrackcount desc
 limit 10 ; 
 
 ## 3. Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. 
 ## Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first
 
select name,milliseconds
from track 
where milliseconds > ( 
select
avg(milliseconds) as avgmilisecond
from track)
order by milliseconds desc
limit 1 ;

/* Question Set 3 - Advance */

/* Q1: Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return customer name, artist name and total spent */

/* Steps to Solve: First, find which artist has earned the most according to the InvoiceLines. Now use this artist to find 
which customer spent the most on this artist. For this query, you will need to use the Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Customer, 
Album, and Artist tables. Note, this one is tricky because the Total spent in the Invoice table might not be on a single product, 
so you need to use the InvoiceLine table to find out how many of each product was purchased, and then multiply this by the price
for each artist. */
